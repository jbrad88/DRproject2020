## Introduction

For this assignment, I have created a database for a music store listing the code, album title, artist and price of each
CD in stock. This includes a basic Flask server that has a REST API, one database table and an accompanying web interface.

## Prerequisites
Before you continue, make sure that you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed Python 3.8.3

## Technologies
Python 3.8.3
Flask
MySQL Connector
Wampserver64

## General Usage Information
1. Download ZIP package and unzip it. The unzipped folder will include the server.py python program and the initdb.sql data set.
2. On a new command line, navigate to the directory containing the (now unzipped) downloaded folder.
3. Make sure that Wampserver64 is running. Run the "server.py program" by simply typing "python" followed by the file name, i.e. python server.py
4. To open the web interface, go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ . From here you can create a new record, or update/delete existing items. The initdb.sql data set will automatically update with any changes.
